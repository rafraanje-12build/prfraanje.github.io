The exponential function :math:`e^x`, sometimes written as :math:`\mathrm{exp}(x)`, is a famous function with many applications. It is defined by the power series [#]_

.. math::
   e^x ~=~ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} ~=~ 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24} + \frac{x^5}{120}+\cdots
   
with :math:`n!` the faculty of the integer :math:`n` and the number :math:`e\,=\,\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{i!}\,\approx\,2.718....` the constant of Euler.

In some sense, the exponential function is a generalisation of the sine and the cosine functions, :math:`\mathrm{sin}(x)` and :math:`\mathrm{cos}(x)` respectively, which are defined as [#]_

.. math::
   \begin{array}{lclcl}
   \mathrm{sin}(x)&=&\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}&=&\displaystyle x-\frac{x^3}{6}+\frac{x^5}{120}-\cdots \\
   \mathrm{cos}(x)&=&\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!}&=&\displaystyle 1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}-\cdots
   \end{array}

One may recognize the similarities in the coefficients with the power series of the :math:`\mathrm{exp}(x)` function. More precisely, when we evaluate the :math:`\mathrm{exp}(x)` function for pure imaginary values of :math:`x`, that is :math:`x=i\alpha` with :math:`\alpha\in\mathbb{R}` an arbitrary real number and :math:`i` the imaginary unit [#]_, such that :math:`i^2=-1`, then one can write

.. math::
   e^{i\alpha}~=~\cos(\alpha) + i\sin(\alpha)

which is known as the Euler's formula [#]_. Evaluating Euler's formula at :math:`\alpha=\pi`, with :math:`\pi` the circle constant [#]_, yields the Euler's identity [#]_

.. math::
   e^{i\pi}+1~=~0

that beautifully relates the mathematical constants :math:`0,\,1,\,i,\,\pi` and :math:`e`.

The exponential function appears as a solution or part of a solution of an equation with differentials, better known as a differential equation [#]_, e.g. of the form

.. math::
   \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} x}~=~ a y(x).

Here :math:`x` may represent a position in a spatial dimension, e.g. in meters, and the function :math:`y(x)` may represent the spatial distribution of a physical quantity, e.g. units of strain or units of electrical charge. Differential equations also show up in describing dynamical systems, then :math:`x` represents time (usually represented by the symbol :math:`t` rather than :math:`x`), expressed e.g. in units of seconds, and :math:`y(x)` represents the position or velocity of a particle as a function of time. Also note, that the (physical) unit of :math:`a` is the inverse of the unit of :math:`x`, to have proper units on both sides of the differential equation, i.e. units of :math:`y` per units of :math:`x`. Hence, if :math:`x` is measured in :math:`\mathrm{s}` (seconds), than :math:`a` has the unit :math:`1/\mathrm{s}\,=\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}`.

The exponential functions appears in the solution :math:`y(x)` of the differential equation, because the exponential function is equal to its derivative, i.e.

.. math::
   \frac{\mathrm{d}e^x}{\mathrm{d} x}~=~ e^x.

This can be verified by term for term differentiating the power series expansion of the exponential function given in the first equation of this article. Therefore :math:`e^x` satisfies the differential equation

.. math::
   \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} x}~=~ y(x).
  
But, note that there are more functions satisfying this differential equation, all are of the form :math:`y(x)\,=\,ce^x` with :math:`c` some number. This number can be determined uniquely if in addition to the differential equation we add another equation, also known as a *constraint*, *initial condition* or *boundary condition*. For example, when :math:`y(0)=3` it follows that :math:`c=3`, because :math:`e^0\,=\,1`. Also note, that the (physical) unit of :math:`c` is the same as the unit of :math:`y`.

Thanks to the chain rule in calculus [#]_ it can be shown that

.. math::
   \frac{\mathrm{d}e^{ax}}{\mathrm{d}x} ~=~ ae^{ax}

which gives *a* solution to the differential equation depending on :math:`a` given above, and all solutions are of the form :math:`y(x)\,=\,ce^{ax}`, with :math:`c` some number determined by the additional constraint. The parameter :math:`a` of the differential equation, can be seen as a *scaling* parameter of the spatial or temporal dimension :math:`x`. This can be seen by dividing the differential equation by :math:`a`, resulting in

.. math::
   \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{a\mathrm{d} x}~=~ y(x)

which, by introducing the scaled dimension parameter :math:`x'\,=\,ax`, can be rewritten in the *normalized* differential equation

.. math::
   \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} x'}~=~ y(x').

Solutions to this differential equation has been shown above as having the form :math:`y(x')=ce^{x'}`, which is only valid over the scaled (or normalized) dimension parameter :math:`x'\,=\,ax`. Rewriting in terms of the *unscaled* dimension parameter :math:`x` yields the form we obtained by applying the chain rule

.. math::
   y(x)~=~ce^{ax}.

As we have seen above, the parameters :math:`c` and :math:`a` are both depending on the units that has been chosen for :math:`y` and :math:`x` respectively. In fact these parameters determine how much we have to scale down :math:`y` by :math:`c` and stretch :math:`x` by :math:`a` to arrive at the exponential function :math:`e^{x'}`.

The above discussion has been performed for :math:`x` and :math:`y` being scalar quantities and the exponential function being a scalar function. However, the exponential function is not limited to scalars, it can be evaluated for matrix quantities as well. Therefore, let :math:`X` be a *square* matrix, then the matrix exponential function is defined (similarly as above in the scalar case) by [#]_

.. math::
   e^X~=~\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{X^n}{n!}~=~I + X + \frac{X^2}{2} + \frac{X^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24} + \frac{X^5}{120} + \cdots.

In the following we replace :math:`X` by the quantity :math:`At` where :math:`A` a square matrix, which generalizes the parameter :math:`a` above to the matrix case, and :math:`t` a scalar quantity representing e.g. time or displacement in a fixed direction, similar as the parameter :math:`x` above. Then, the matrix exponential function

.. math::
   e^{At}

has a beatiful derivative with respect to the scalar quantity :math:`t`, given by

.. math::
   \frac{\mathrm{d}e^{At}}{\mathrm{d}t}~=~Ae^{At},

which can be verified, similar as in the scalar case, by taking term for term the derivative of the power series of the matrix exponential function. 

This result can be applied to solve coupled differential equations, that show up in e.g. linear dynamic systems with various lumped components, such as mass-spring-demper systems or RLC-networks in the electrical domain. Often, the differential equations can be ordered in such a way that they can be written in the form

.. math::
   \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t}~=~ A y(t)

where now :math:`y(t)` is a (column) vector signal having as many elements as the rows or columns of the square matrix :math:`A`. Note, that to have the units being identical on both sides of this vector differential equation, the unit of :math:`A` should be the inverse of the unit of :math:`t`. For dynamic systems :math:`t` usually has the unit :math:`\mathrm{s}` and thus :math:`A` has the unit :math:`\mathrm{s}^{-1}`.
