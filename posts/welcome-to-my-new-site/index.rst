Welcome to my new site, at which I want to write about various topics, such as math, programming, e.g. in Python_, (learning) control systems, dynamics, and the `Robot Operating System (ROS)`_. As a researcher and lecturer at `The Hague University of Applied Sciences`_ besides books and papers also blog posts are an invaluable source of information. I have made several attempts in the past to start a blog myself, but these stranded partly because lack of time and partly because of the complexity of the tools. The Nikola_ static site generator I am using now, has been chosen for its ease of configuration and its ability to embed Jupyter_ notebooks, that I may use in future posts. If you have comments or questions regaring the contents on my blog, just send me an email or leave a comment when I have the comment system operational.
