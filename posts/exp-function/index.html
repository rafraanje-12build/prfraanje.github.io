<p>The exponential function <span class="math">\(e^x\)</span>, sometimes written as <span class="math">\(\mathrm{exp}(x)\)</span>, is a famous function with many applications, far more than just exponential growth and decay. It is defined by the power series <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id21" id="id1">1</a></p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
e^x ~=~ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} ~=~ 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24} + \frac{x^5}{120}+\cdots
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>with <span class="math">\(n!\)</span> the faculty of the integer <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and the number <span class="math">\(e\,=\,\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}\,\approx\,2.718....\)</span> the constant of Euler, after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707 - 1783) <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id22" id="id2">2</a>.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>In some sense, the exponential function is a generalisation of the sine and the cosine functions, <span class="math">\(\mathrm{sin}(x)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathrm{cos}(x)\)</span> respectively, which are defined as <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id23" id="id3">3</a></p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{lclcl}
\mathrm{sin}(x)&amp;=&amp;\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}&amp;=&amp;\displaystyle x-\frac{x^3}{6}+\frac{x^5}{120}-\cdots \\
\mathrm{cos}(x)&amp;=&amp;\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!}&amp;=&amp;\displaystyle 1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}-\cdots
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>One may recognize the similarities in the coefficients with the power series of the <span class="math">\(\mathrm{exp}(x)\)</span> function. More precisely, when we evaluate the <span class="math">\(\mathrm{exp}(x)\)</span> function for pure imaginary values of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, that is <span class="math">\(x=i\alpha\)</span> with <span class="math">\(\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\)</span> an arbitrary real number and <span class="math">\(i\)</span> the imaginary unit <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id24" id="id4">4</a>, such that <span class="math">\(i^2=-1\)</span>, then one can write</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
e^{i\alpha}~=~\cos(\alpha) + i\sin(\alpha)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which is known as the Euler's formula <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id25" id="id5">5</a>. So, by applying the exponential function to <em>imaginary</em> numbers the exponential function splits in some sense in two separate functions: the real part being the <em>cosine</em> and the imaginary part being the <em>sine</em> function. This 'splitting' is thanks to the property of the <em>imaginary</em> unit <span class="math">\(i\)</span> that by squaring <span class="math">\(i\)</span> it yields a <em>real</em> number (<span class="math">\(i^2\,=\,-1\)</span>), and thus <span class="math">\(i^n\)</span> is real for even and imaginary for odd values of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Moreover, the alternating signs in the power series of the sine and the cosine functions are due to the fact that <span class="math">\((-1)^n\)</span> is <span class="math">\(+1\)</span> for even and <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> for odd values of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thanks to this splitting in sine and cosine functions, the exponential function applied to imaginary or complex numbers can be used to describe oscillatory behavior in dynamic systems, as well as making rotations, projections and reflections in geometry. To be able to perform this in three rather than two dimensions, the imaginary or complex number may be replaced by a so called <em>quaternion</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id26" id="id6">6</a> or an even more general <em>rotor</em> or <em>motor</em> in the field of geometric algebra <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id27" id="id7">7</a>, which may be the topic of another blog post.</p>
<p>Evaluating Euler's formula at <span class="math">\(\alpha=\pi\)</span>, with <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> the circle constant <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id28" id="id8">8</a>, yields the Euler's identity <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id29" id="id9">9</a></p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
e^{i\pi}+1~=~0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>that beautifully relates five mathematical constants: <span class="math">\(0,\,1,\,i,\,\pi\)</span> and <span class="math">\(e\)</span>.</p>
<p>The inverse of the exponential function is the natural logarithm function <span class="math">\(\mathrm{ln}(x)\)</span>, such that <span class="math">\(\mathrm{ln}(e^x)\,=\,x\)</span> and in addition,  provided <span class="math">\(x&gt;0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(e^{\mathrm{ln}(x)}\,=\,x\)</span> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id30" id="id10">10</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="solving-differential-equations">
<h2>Solving differential equations</h2>
<p>The exponential function appears as a solution or part of a solution of an equation with differentials, better known as a differential equation <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id31" id="id11">11</a>, e.g. of the form</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} x}~=~ a y(x).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Here <span class="math">\(x\)</span> may represent a position in a spatial dimension, e.g. in meters, and the function <span class="math">\(y(x)\)</span> may represent the spatial distribution of a physical quantity, e.g. units of strain or units of electrical charge. Differential equations also show up in describing dynamical systems, then <span class="math">\(x\)</span> represents time (usually represented by the symbol <span class="math">\(t\)</span> rather than <span class="math">\(x\)</span>), expressed e.g. in units of seconds, and <span class="math">\(y(x)\)</span> represents the position or velocity of a particle as a function of time. Also note, that the (physical) unit of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is the inverse of the unit of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, to have proper units on both sides of the differential equation, i.e. units of <span class="math">\(y\)</span> per units of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. Hence, if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is measured in <span class="math">\(\mathrm{s}\)</span> (seconds), than <span class="math">\(a\)</span> has the unit <span class="math">\(1/\mathrm{s}\,=\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The exponential functions appears in the solution <span class="math">\(y(x)\)</span> of the differential equation, because the exponential function is equal to its derivative, i.e.</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d}e^x}{\mathrm{d} x}~=~ e^x.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This property can be verified by term for term differentiating the power series expansion of the exponential function given in the first equation of this article. Therefore <span class="math">\(e^x\)</span> satisfies the differential equation</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} x}~=~ y(x).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>But, note that there are more functions satisfying this differential equation, all are of the form <span class="math">\(y(x)\,=\,ce^x\)</span> with <span class="math">\(c\)</span> some number. This number can be determined uniquely if in addition to the differential equation we add another equation, also known as a <em>constraint</em>, <em>initial condition</em> or <em>boundary condition</em>. For example, when <span class="math">\(y(0)=3\)</span> it follows that <span class="math">\(c=3\)</span>, because <span class="math">\(e^0\,=\,1\)</span>. Also note, that the (physical) unit of <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is the same as the unit of <span class="math">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the chain rule in calculus <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id32" id="id12">12</a> it can be shown that</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d}e^{ax}}{\mathrm{d}x} ~=~ ae^{ax}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which gives <em>a</em> solution to the differential equation depending on <span class="math">\(a\)</span> given above, and all solutions are of the form <span class="math">\(y(x)\,=\,ce^{ax}\)</span>, with <span class="math">\(c\)</span> some number determined by the additional constraint. The parameter <span class="math">\(a\)</span> of the differential equation, can be seen as a <em>scaling</em> parameter of the spatial or temporal dimension <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. This can be seen by dividing the differential equation by <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, resulting in</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{a\mathrm{d} x}~=~ y(x)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which, by introducing the scaled dimension parameter <span class="math">\(x'\,=\,ax\)</span>, can be rewritten in the <em>normalized</em> differential equation</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} x'}~=~ y(x').
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Solutions to this differential equation has been shown above as having the form <span class="math">\(y(x')=ce^{x'}\)</span>, which is only valid over the scaled (or normalized) dimension parameter <span class="math">\(x'\,=\,ax\)</span>. Rewriting in terms of the <em>unscaled</em> dimension parameter <span class="math">\(x\)</span> yields the form we obtained by applying the chain rule</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
y(x)~=~ce^{ax}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>As we have seen above, the parameters <span class="math">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a\)</span> are both depending on the units that have been chosen for <span class="math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x\)</span> respectively. In fact these parameters determine how much we have to scale down <span class="math">\(y\)</span> by <span class="math">\(c\)</span> and stretch <span class="math">\(x\)</span> by <span class="math">\(a\)</span> to arrive at the exponential function <span class="math">\(e^{x'}\)</span>. Or stated otherwise, <span class="math">\(c\)</span> determines how much units the physical quantity <span class="math">\(y\)</span> represents and the parameter <span class="math">\(a\)</span> specifies how <em>fast</em> <span class="math">\(y\)</span> is changing as <span class="math">\(x\)</span> evolves, which is after all just what the differential equation <span class="math">\(\mathrm{d}y/\mathrm{d}x\,=\,ay(x)\)</span> is saying.</p>
<p>Besides the special case of <span class="math">\(a=1\)</span> leading to the normalized differential equation, it is illustrative to interprete the differential equation and its solution for <span class="math">\(a=0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a=-1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a\to+\infty\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a\to-\infty\)</span>. Note, that nothing witholds you (and is really rewarding) to study the equations for imaginary values <span class="math">\(a=i\alpha\)</span> (<span class="math">\(\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\)</span>) and more general complex values <span class="math">\(a=\alpha+i\beta\)</span> (<span class="math">\(\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{R}\)</span>) as well!</p>

<div class="section" id="the-matrix-exponential">
<h2>The matrix exponential</h2>
<p>The above discussion has been performed for <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> being scalar quantities and the exponential function being a scalar function. However, the exponential function is not limited to scalars, it can be applied on other mathematical objects such as a <em>matrix</em> as well. Therefore, let <span class="math">\(X\)</span> be a <em>square</em> matrix, then the matrix exponential function is defined (similarly as above in the scalar case) by <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id33" id="id13">13</a></p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
e^X~=~\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{X^n}{n!}~=~I + X + \frac{X^2}{2} + \frac{X^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24} + \frac{X^5}{120} + \cdots.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(I\)</span> the identity matrix having the same dimension as <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. So the matrix exponential <span class="math">\(e^X\)</span> is a square matrix as well having the same dimension as <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the following we replace <span class="math">\(X\)</span> by the quantity <span class="math">\(At\)</span> where <span class="math">\(A\)</span> a square matrix, which generalizes the parameter <span class="math">\(a\)</span> above to the matrix case, and <span class="math">\(t\)</span> a scalar quantity representing e.g. time or displacement in a fixed direction, similar as the parameter <span class="math">\(x\)</span> above. Then, the matrix exponential function <span class="math">\(e^{At}\)</span>
has a beautiful derivative with respect to the scalar quantity <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, given by</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d}e^{At}}{\mathrm{d}t}~=~Ae^{At},
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which can be verified, similar as in the scalar case, by taking term for term the derivative of the power series of the matrix exponential function. Note, we could have written <span class="math">\(\mathrm{d}e^{At}/\mathrm{d}t\,=\,e^{At}A\)</span> as well, so <span class="math">\(A\)</span> commutes with <span class="math">\(e^{At}\)</span>, though matrix products do not commute in general!</p>
<p>This result can be applied to solve <em>coupled</em> differential equations, that show up in e.g. linear dynamic systems with multiple lumped components, such as mass-spring-damper systems or RLC-networks in the electrical domain. Often, the differential equations can be ordered in such a way that they can be written in the form of the following vector differential equation</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t}~=~ A y(t)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where now <span class="math">\(y(t)\)</span> is a (column) vector signal having as many elements as the rows or columns of the square matrix <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Note, that to have the units being identical on both sides of this vector differential equation, the unit of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> should be the inverse of the unit of <span class="math">\(t\)</span>. For dynamic systems <span class="math">\(t\)</span> usually has the unit <span class="math">\(\mathrm{s}\)</span> and thus <span class="math">\(A\)</span> has the unit <span class="math">\(\mathrm{s}^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The solutions to the vector differential equation have the form</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
y(t)~=~e^{At}c
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(c\)</span> a (column) vector having the same dimension and unit as <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, and can be determined when an additional condition on <span class="math">\(y(t)\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is added, often an initial condition <span class="math">\(y(0)=c\)</span> because <span class="math">\(e^{At}\,=\,I\)</span> for <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the scalar case when <span class="math">\(A\,=\,a\in\mathbb{R}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> the evolution of <span class="math">\(e^{at}\)</span> is as studied above. The case <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a <span class="math">\(2\times2\)</span> matrix or of higher dimension is more complex. However, the scalar case simply extends to the matrix case when <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a <em>diagonal</em> matrix, i.e. a matrix with arbitrary values <span class="math">\(a_k\)</span> on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Here, the subscript <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is an integer referring to the corresponding position on the diagonal of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. In this case of diagonal <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, the matrix exponential <span class="math">\(e^{At}\)</span> is a diagonal matrix as well with diagonal elements <span class="math">\(e^{a_kt}\)</span>, similar to the scalar case. In fact, when <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is diagonal the equations in the vector differential equation are not coupled and can be considered as multiple scalar differential equations.</p>
<p>More difficult is the situation when one or more <em>off-diagonal</em> elements of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> are nonzero. In this case the matrix should be made <em>diagonal</em> or <em>'almost' diagonal</em> by making certain transformations, based on the eigenvalue decomposition <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id34" id="id14">14</a> or the Jordan normal form <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id35" id="id15">15</a> respectively. The resulting solutions contain <span class="math">\(e^{\lambda_k t}\)</span> where <span class="math">\(\lambda_k\)</span> an <em>eigenvalue</em> that has the same meaning as <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in the scalar case, and can be:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>real, equivalent to exponential growth or decay;</p></li>
<li><p>imaginary, harmonic oscillatory behavior;</p></li>
<li><p>complex, growing or decaying harmonic oscillatory behavior.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In another blog post, we may go in further detail about this, for now we refer to some youtube-videos of MIT math professor Gilbert Strang on Diagonalizing a Matrix <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id36" id="id16">16</a> and The Matrix Exponential <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id37" id="id17">17</a>.</p>
<p>In this article we have only considered <em>autonomous</em> systems, i.e. systems without applying external inputs, such as disturbances or controls. Extending to dynamic systems with external inputs will result in the so called State-space representation <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id38" id="id18">18</a>, that may also be the topic of another post.</p>
<p>I would like to finish this article on the exponential function with poiting to another inspiring YouTube video by Colin Smith on Physics in Clojure <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id39" id="id19">19</a>,
that ends with a <em>weird trick</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id40" id="id20">20</a> obtained by applying the exponential function not on a number but on the <em>differential operator</em>, which however is very similar to the called Laplace and Fourier transforms, that are on their turn strongly build on the exponential function as well.</p>
<p>I hope you found this article informative. Please, let me known when you liked it or have some questions or comments.</p>
