Hello, I'm Rufus Fraanje (baptized as Petrus Rufus Fraanje, after my grandfather Pieter Fraanje). I live in `Delft <https://www.delft.nl/en/>`_, the Netherlands, where I work as robotics and control lecturer and researcher at `The Hague University of Applied Sciences (THUAS) <https://www.thehagueuniversity.com/>`_. Besides my work, I enjoy walking in nature, alone and with friends, playing the trumpet (Martin Committee) and taking part in the local church community of the `Immanuelkerk <https://www.gkvdelft.nl/>`_.

You can contact me through `private email <mailto:rufus|DOT|fraanje|AT|solcon|DOT|nl/>`_, `work email <mailto:p|DOT|r|DOT|fraanje|AT|hhs|DOT|nl/>`_ (please remove the anti-spam characters) or `Linked-In <https://www.linkedin.com/in/rufusfraanje/>`_. You may find most of my publications at `Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WInsNAoAAAAJ/>`_.
