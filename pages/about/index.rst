Hello, I'm Rufus Fraanje (baptized as Petrus Rufus Fraanje, after my grandfather Pieter Fraanje). I live in Delft_, the Netherlands, where I work as robotics and control lecturer and researcher at `The Hague University of Applied Sciences (THUAS)`_. Besides my work, I enjoy walking in nature, alone and with friends, playing the trumpet (Martin Committee) and taking part in the local church community of the Immanuelkerk_.

You can contact me through `private email`_, `work email`_ (please remove the anti-spam characters) or Linked-In_. You may find most of my publications at `Google Scholar`_. Some of my programming projects are available from Github_.
